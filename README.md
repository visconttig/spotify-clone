## Notice

Thank you for visiting the repository for this project. We appreciate your interest and support. Unfortunately, we must inform you that this project is now unmaintained due to significant increases in API pricing, which have rendered the project unsustainable.

## Why Unmaintained?

The foundation of our project relied heavily on integrating with certain API, and we initially saw it as a valuable resource.

However, over time, the costs associated with using this API have skyrocketed. We want to emphasize that it was a difficult decision to stop maintenance on this project. We believe in its potential, but in light of the current pricing model, continuing to invest resources is unfortunately not viable.
